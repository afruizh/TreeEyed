A QGIS plugin for tree monitoring using AI.

## Features
This plugins seeks to integrate existing and custom AI models for tree monitoring (semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and object detection).

Apart from the model handling this plugin facilitates the integration with QGIS layers for image extraction and post-processing. Additional features for dataset creation and validation in COCO format are available.
